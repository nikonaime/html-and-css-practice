        <p>Twitter shut down Dom Hoffman’s app Vine,  giving away the short-form video goldmine to China’s TikTok. Now a year and half since Hoffman announced he’d reimagine the app as V2 then scrapped that name, his follow-up to Vine called Byte has finally sent out the first 100 invites to its closed beta. Byte will let users record or upload short, looped vertical videos to what’s currently a reverse-chronological feed.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the byte beta we’ve been running with friends and family *feels* exactly like the vine friends and family beta, down to the weird but appealing randomness of the videos. that’ll change as we expand, but it’s a pretty good sign <a href="https://t.co/rBbQrNtTJ7">pic.twitter.com/rBbQrNtTJ7</a></p>&mdash; dom hofmann (@dhof) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1120427319078862848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2019</a></blockquote>

        <p>It will be a long uphill climb for Byte given TikTok's massive popularity. But if it differentiates by focusing less on lip syncing and teen non-sense so it's less alienating to an older audience, there might be room for a homegrown competitor in short-form video entertainment.</p>

<p>Hoffman tells TechCrunch that he's emboldened by the off-the-cuff nature of the beta community, which he believes proves the app is compelling even before lots of creative and funny video makers join. He says his top priority is doing right by creators so they'll be lined up to give Byte a shot when it officially launches even if they could get more views elsewhere.</p>

<p>For now, Hoffman plans to keep running beta tests, adding and subtracting features for a trial by fire to see what works and what's unnecessary. The current version is just camera recordings with no uploads, and just a feed with Likes and comments but no account following. Upcoming iterations from his seven-person team will test video uploads and profiles.</p>

<p>One reassuring point is that Hoffman is well aware that TikTok's epic rise has changed the landscape. He admits that Byte can't win with the exact same playbook Vine did when it faced an open field, and it must bring something unique. Hoffman tells me he's a big fan of TikTok, and sees it as one evolutionary step past Vine, but not in the same direction as his new app</p>

<p>Does the world need Vine back if TikTok already has over 500 million active users? We'll soon find out of Hoffman can take a Byte of that market.</p>
