<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h1><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.</p>
<p>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The name <em>cascading</em> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading <strong>priority</strong> scheme is predictable.</p>
