<h2>Development</h2>
<p>In 1980, physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong></a>, a contractor at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system.</p>

<h2>January 14, 1997</h2>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <strong>W3C</strong>, as the <strong>IETF</strong> had closed its <strong>HTML</strong> <strong>Working</strong> <strong>Group</strong> on September 12, 1996. â€‹Initially code-named &quot;Wilbur&quot;, <strong>HTML</strong> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <strong><em>Netscape's blink</em></strong> element and <strong><em>Microsoft's</em></strong> marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.</p>
<p>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>
