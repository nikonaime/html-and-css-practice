        <p><b>Casting time every night</b> debating with yourself or your partner about what to watch on Netflix is a drag. It burns people’s time and good will, robs great creators of attention and leaves Netflix  vulnerable to competitors who can solve discovery. A Reelgood study estimated that the average user spends 18 minutes per day deciding.</p>
        <p>To date, Netflix’s solution has been its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence that offers personalized recommendations. But that algorithm is ignorant of how we’re feeling in the moment, what we’ve already seen elsewhere and if we’re factoring in what someone else with us wants to watch too.</p>

        <h2>Netflix channels</h2>
        <p>For the history of broadcast television, people surfed their way to what to watch. They turned on the tube, flipped through a few favorite channels and jumped in even if a show or movie had already started. They didn’t have to decide between infinite options, and they didn’t have to commit to starting from the beginning. We all have that guilty pleasure we’ll watch until the end whenever we stumble upon it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Netflix could harness that laziness and repurpose the concept of channels so you could surf its on-demand catalog the same way. Imagine if Netflix created channels dedicated to cartoons, action, comedy or history. It could curate non-stop streams of cherry-picked content, mixing classic episodes and films, new releases related to current events, thematically relevant seasonal video and Netflix’s own Original titles it wants to promote.</p>

        <h3>The nightly water-cooler pick</h3>
        <P>One thing we’ve lost with the rise of on-demand video are some of those zeitgeist moments where everyone watches the same thing the same night and can then talk about it together the next day. We still get that with live sports, the occasional tent-pole premiere like Game of Thrones or when a series drops for binge-watching like Stranger Things. But Netflix has the ubiquity to manufacture those moments that stimulate conversation and a sense of unity.</P>
        <br>
        <p>Netflix could choose one piece of programming per night per region, perhaps a movie, short arc of TV episodes or one of the short film bundles I suggested above and stick it prominently on the home page. This Netflix zeitgeist choice would help override people’s picky preferences that get them stuck browsing by applying peer pressure like, “well, this is what everyone else will be watching.”</p>
