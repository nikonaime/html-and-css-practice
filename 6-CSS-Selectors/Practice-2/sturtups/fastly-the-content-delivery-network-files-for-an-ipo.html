        <p><h2><i>Fastly</i></h2> <em>the content delivery network that’s raised $219 million in financing from investors (according to Crunchbase), is ready for its close up in the public markets.</em></p>
        <hr>
        <b>The eight-year-old company</b> is one of several businesses that improve the download time and delivery of different websites to internet browsers and it has just filed for an IPO.
        <p>Media companies like The New York Times use Fastly  to cache their homepages, media and articles on Fastly’s servers so that when somebody wants to browse the Times online </p>
        <p>Fastly’s servers can send it directly to the browser. In some cases, Fastly serves up to 90 percent of browser requests.
        E-commerce companies like Stripe  and Ticketmaster are also big users of the service. They appreciate Fastly because its network of servers enable faster load times — sometimes as quickly as 20 or 30 milliseconds, according to the company.
        The company raised its last round of financing roughly nine months ago, a $40 million investment that Fastly said would be the last before a public offering.</p>
        <p><b> to its word, the company is hoping public markets have the appetite to feast on yet another “unicorn” business.</p></b>
        <p>While Fastly lacks the sizzle of companies like Zoom, Pinterest or Lyft, its technology enables a huge portion of the activities in which consumers engage online, and it could be a bellwether for competitors like Cloudflare, which recently raised $150 million and was also exploring a public listing.</p>
        <p>The company’s public filing has a placeholder amount of $100 million, but given the amount of funding the company has received, it’s far more likely to seek closer to $1 billion when it finally prices its shares.</p>
        <p>Fastly reported revenue of roughly $145 million in 2018, compared to $105 million in 2017, and its losses declined year on year to $29 million, down from $31 million in the year-ago period. So its losses are shrinking, its revenue is growing (albeit slowly) and its cost of revenues are rising from $46 million to around $65 million over the same period.</p>
        <p>That’s not a great number for the company, but it’s offset by the amount of money that the company’s getting from its customers. Fastly breaks out that number in its dollar-based net expansion rate figure, which grew 132 percent in 2018.</p>
